# My Engineering Learning Path

## Why this repo exists
I use this repository to document how I evolve from
a JS beginner into a system-oriented Web developer.

This is NOT a tutorial list.
This repo focuses on decisions, trade-offs, and reflections.

## Current Stage
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript fundamentals
- Building small but complete projects
- Transitioning into React

## Milestones
### Milestone 1: Vanilla JS ToDo List
- What I built
- What problems I encountered
- Why it doesn't scale well

### Milestone 2: React ToDo List
- How state-driven UI changes my thinking
- What React solves and what it hides

(Next milestones planned...)
